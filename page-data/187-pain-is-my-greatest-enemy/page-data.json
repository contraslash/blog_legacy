Ive searched far and wide to find ways to kill it. But eventually i realized that pain is not the enemy. Its a no nonsense, no bullshit, honest friend. Pain is a signal for you to heal. Its a sign that there’s something wrong and im not just talking about the physical, it tells you there’s a relationship that needs attending to, that challenges your strength, your faith and humility. But painkillers they only hide the pain, but They don’t take it away. The best way to recover from pain is to endure it. Then and only then can we heal. Simply put… If there is no healing there is no pain”.
