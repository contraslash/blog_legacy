We’ve put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;your blog URL&gt;/ghost/</code>. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!</p>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it’s a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!</p>\n<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Item number one</li>\n<li>\n<p>Item number two</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A nested item</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A final item</li>\n</ul>\n<p>or with numbers!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remember to buy some milk</li>\n<li>Drink the milk</li>\n<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like <a href=\"http://ghost.org\">http://ghost.org</a> - it’ll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here’s a link to <a href=\"http://ghost.org\">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>\n<h3>What about Images?</h3>\n<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>\n<p>{&#x3C;1>}<img src=\"https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png\" alt=\"The Ghost Logo\"></p>\n<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That’s ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>\n<p>{&#x3C;2>}![A bowl of bananas]</p>\n<h3>Quoting</h3>\n<p>Sometimes a link isn’t enough, you want to quote someone on what they’ve said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it’s definitely a word.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wisdomous - it’s definitely a word.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Working with Code</h3>\n<p>Got a streak of geek? We’ve got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">.awesome-thing {\n    display: block;\n    width: 100%;\n}</code></pre></div>\n<h3>Ready for a Break?</h3>\n<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you’ve got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Advanced Usage</h3>\n<p>There’s one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it’ll still work! Very flexible.</p>\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome to Ghost","date":"January 29, 2016","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/74-instalar-apache-cordova-e-ionic-en-ubuntu-14-04/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Instalar Apache Cordova e Ionic en Ubuntu 14.04"}},"next":null}}}
